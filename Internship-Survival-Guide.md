# Part 1: Office Life & Documentation (The Corporate Playbook)

## 📝 Section 1.1: What to Document Daily

### The 5-Line Daily Log (End of Day - 5 mins max)

Keep it simple. Use your **phone notes app** - not Notion, not fancy tools you won't open.

```
## [Date]
### Done
- [Task completed] ✅
- [Another task] ✅

### Blockers
- [What's stopping you]

### Learned
- [One new thing you learned today]

### Tomorrow
- [Priority task for next day]
```

**Example:**
```
## 17 Jan 2026
### Done
- Fixed login API timeout issue ✅
- Reviewed Rahul's PR #234 ✅

### Blockers
- Waiting for DB access from DevOps

### Learned
- Connection pooling in PostgreSQL

### Tomorrow
- Complete unit tests for user service
```

### Why This Matters:
| Situation | How Your Log Helps |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Performance Review | You have 6 months of proof |
| 1:1 with Manager | Ready talking points |
| Resume Update | Real examples to add |
| Someone steals credit | You have dated records |

---

## 📧 Section 1.2: Task Confirmation (The Paper Trail)

### For Indian Interns: WhatsApp > Email

Email feels too formal and "I don't trust you" vibe in Indian offices. Use **WhatsApp** instead.

### Template 1: After Manager Gives Verbal Task

```
Sir, noted 👍
- Login bug fix on staging
- Priority: High
- Will complete by tomorrow EOD

Please let me know if I missed anything.
```

**Screenshot this. Keep in a folder.**

### Template 2: When Colleague Asks for Extra Help

```
Sure, happy to help!
Just checking - should I loop in [Manager name] for visibility 
since this might need some time from my current work?
```

**Why this works:**
- Manager knows you're helping
- You get credit
- Not throwing colleague under bus
- Professional and humble

### Template 3: Task Completion Update

```
Sir, done ✅
- Fixed the login redirect issue
- Tested on staging
- PR raised: #456

Let me know if anything else needed.
```

## 🙏 Section 1.3: Indian Office Politics - Ego Management

### Rule 1: Senior Ko Credit Do (Even If You Did 100% Work)

**Scenario:** You fixed a tough bug, manager asks in meeting "kaun kiya?"

| ❌ DON'T Say | ✅ DO Say |
|-------------|----------|
| "Maine kiya!" | "Sir, [Senior name] ne guide kiya tha, maine implement kiya" |

**Why?**
- Senior feels respected → Will actually help you next time
- You still get mentioned
- No one's ego hurt
- You learn to play the long game

### Rule 2: Never Correct Senior Publicly

**Scenario:** Senior says something technically wrong in meeting.

| ❌ DON'T Do | ✅ DO This |
|------------|----------|
| "Actually sir, that's not how React hooks work..." | Wait. After meeting, privately: "Sir, woh ek doubt tha, can you explain this part?" |

Let them "realize" the correct answer. They save face, you stay safe.

### Rule 3: Hierarchy Words Matter

| Person | How to Address |
|--------|---------------|
| Manager | Sir/Ma'am ALWAYS |
| Seniors (2-3 yrs ahead) | Start formal, observe their vibe |
| Direct peers | First name is fine |

**Pro Tip:** First 2 weeks, watch how others address seniors. Copy that.

### Rule 4: Chai Break Politics

> "Office politics doesn't happen in meetings. It happens in chai breaks."

- Eat lunch with team when invited
- Join chai breaks
- Don't wear earphones all day (seems unapproachable)
- Attend team outings

---

## 🌟 Section 1.4: Getting Credit Without Bragging

### The Subtle Art of Visibility

**In Standups:**

| ❌ Sounds Like Bragging | ✅ Sounds Professional |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "I fixed that huge bug everyone was struggling with!" | "I investigated the timeout issue - root cause was connection pooling. Made a fix, PR #456. Happy to walk through if anyone's interested." |

**Key Phrases That Work:**
- "I found an interesting pattern while debugging..."
- "One thing I learned from this task..."
- "The root cause was actually..."

### Weekly Update Message (GOLD TRICK)

Send this to your manager every Friday:

```
Sir, quick weekly update:

✅ Done:
- Fixed 3 bugs (AUTH-123, DB-456, API-789)
- Reviewed 5 PRs
- Improved API response time by 40%

🔄 In Progress:
- User dashboard (70% done)

📅 Next Week:
- Complete dashboard
- Start notification service

Happy to discuss if needed!
```

**Why this is GOLD:**
- Manager has written record
- No one can steal credit
- You seem organized
- Promotion/raise time - they remember

## ⏰ Section 1.5: Intern's Daily Routine

| Time | What to Do |
|------|-----------|
| **10 mins before office** | Be there. Never late as intern. |
| **First 30 mins** | Read emails, Slack. Understand what's happening. |
| **If no task assigned** | ASK: "Sir, aaj kya help kar sakta hoon?" |
| **During work** | Keep phone away. Be SEEN working. |
| **Lunch** | Eat with team if invited. Bonding time. |
| **Before leaving** | Ask: "Sir, kuch pending hai?" Then leave. |
| **Last 5 mins** | Update your daily log. |

## 🛡️ Section 1.6: Protecting Yourself

### The 5 Survival Rules

1. **Trust, but verify** - Document important conversations
2. **Help everyone, but make it visible** - CC/loop manager on big tasks
3. **Never badmouth anyone** - Even if someone takes your credit
4. **Build allies** - Be genuinely helpful to 2-3 people
5. **Under-promise, over-deliver** - Say Thursday, deliver Wednesday

### When Senior Dumps Their Work on You

**Reality:** Common. "Yeh chhota kaam hai, tu kar de"

**Strategy:**
- If learning opportunity → Do it happily
- If repeated grunt work → "Sir, abhi [actual task] pe hu, manager ne priority bola. Baad me help karu?"

You're not saying NO - you're saying you have work from manager.

## 🚫 Section 1.7: Things That Get You Labelled "Attitude Problem"

| ❌ Avoid This | Why It's Bad |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Actually sir, there's a better way..." | Ego hurt = you're done |
| Leaving exactly at 6:00 PM | "Not dedicated" (unfair but true) |
| Wearing earphones all day | Seems unapproachable |
| Always eating lunch alone | "Team player nahi hai" |
| Not attending team outings | "Doesn't fit culture" |
| Coming late even once in first month | First impression ruined |

# Part 2: Meal Management (13-25 Jan Survival)

## 🏠 Section 2.1: Your Situation

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Parents | In Uttarakhand (13-25 Jan) |
| Brother | With you in Ahmedabad |
| Commute | 45 mins one way = 1.5 hrs/day |
| Work hours | 8-9 hours + travel = 10+ hours gone |
| Available time | 3-4 hours at home (awake) |

**Accept this now:** You CANNOT cook elaborate meals. Survival mode ON.

---

## 🍳 Section 2.2: Your Meal Strategy (What You Planned)

### Breakfast Options (5-10 mins)
- Fruits (apple, banana, guava) + chai/coffee
- Dahi chawal (curd rice - made night before)
- Bread + butter/jam (backup)

### Lunch (Pack in Morning)
- Roti + Gutke aloo (roasted potato)
- Dahi chawal in dabba

### Dinner (15-20 mins)
- Roti + sabzi (gutke aloo / simple dal)
- Rice + dal

---

## 🫓 Section 2.3: Your Dough Plan - Important Tips

### What You Said:
> "I will dough flour for roti and parathas, keep in fridge, use portion when needed"

### ⚠️ Reality Check:

| Storage Duration | Dough Condition |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1-2 days | Good, usable |
| 3-4 days | Gets dry, hard, sour smell |
| 5+ days | Not recommended |

### Better Approach:

**Option A:** Make dough every alternate day (30 mins every 2 days)

**Option B:** Buy ready rotis from local shop (many shops sell fresh ones)

**Option C:** Make larger batch but freeze portions
- Divide dough into balls
- Wrap each in plastic wrap
- Freeze
- Take out night before, thaw in fridge

### For Paratha:
- Make aloo stuffing for 3-4 days → Keep in fridge
- Stuffing lasts longer than dough
